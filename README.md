### S3 and SNS Management Script

This script utilizes the AWS SDK for Python (`boto3`) to interact with Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service). It performs various tasks related to managing buckets, uploading files, deleting objects, and listing resources.
As instructed by DataCamp, this is a session on interacting with S3.
#### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have:

- AWS credentials (access key ID and secret access key) with appropriate permissions to interact with S3 and SNS.
- Python installed on your system.
- `boto3` library installed. You can install it via pip: `pip install boto3`.
